Our market beat strategy uses four key metrics: beta, Sharpe ratio, moving averages, and P/E ratio.

Beta: We focus on stocks with a beta greater than 1, meaning they move more than the market, ensuring stronger growth when the market rises.

Sharpe Ratio: This helps us balance risk by selecting stocks with good returns relative to risk, reducing the potential downside of high-beta stocks.

Moving Averages: We compare short-term and long-term moving averages to filter out stocks with negative trends, favoring those showing growth.

P/E Ratio: We use the P/E ratio to determine portfolio weighting, giving more weight to stocks with higher growth potential while using other metrics to avoid overvalued stocks.

After filtering stocks, we rank and score them to allocate portfolio weight accordingly, prioritizing stocks that align best with our strategy. A historical performance graph from September helps assess the strategyâ€™s effectiveness.

This approach aims to outperform the market while managing risk and ensuring growth.
